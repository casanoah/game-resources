# game-resources
Pathfinder RPG resources for the gaming group!

Lore handouts will be in the 'handouts' folder. I will try to keep this updated with anything that you pick up! 
As for notes, character sheets, or any role-playing materials, feel free to structure however you'd like as long as you're not just dumping everything into root. Remember to push!
