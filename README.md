# game-resources
Pathfinder RPG resources for the gaming group!

I will try to keep this updated with anything that you pick up! 
As for notes, character sheets, or any role-playing materials, feel free to structure 
however you'd like as long as you're not just dumping everything into root. Remember to push!

As for initial resources, you should first take a look at the House Rules, which are pretty unrelated to everything
else but much more important, then read as much of the other materials as you'd like. You will be able to understand
the setting just fine with nothing but the Almanac if you don't feel like lore.
